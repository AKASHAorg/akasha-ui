One day, his advisors came to him\n        with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"h2\" className=\"mt-10\">\n        The King's Plan\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"p\" className=\"mt-6\">\n        The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"#\"\n          className=\"font-medium text-primary underline underline-offset-4\"\n        >\n          a brilliant plan\n        </a>\n        : he would tax the jokes in the kingdom.\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"h3\" className=\"mt-8\">\n        The Joke Tax\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"p\" className=\"mt-6\">\n        The king's subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but\n        the king was firm:\n      </Typography>\n      <ul className=\"my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2\">\n        <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>\n        <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>\n        <li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>\n      </ul>\n      <Typography variant=\"p\" className=\"mt-6\">\n        As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a\n        gloom. But there was one person who refused to let the king's\n        foolishness get him down: a court jester named Jokester.\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"h3\" className=\"mt-8\">\n        Jokester's Revolt\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"p\" className=\"mt-6\">\n        Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and\n        leaving jokes all over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup,\n        even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn't seem to\n        stop Jokester.\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"p\" className=\"mt-6\">\n        And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes\n        left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh. And\n        once they started laughing, they couldn't stop.\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"h3\" className=\"mt-8\">\n        The People's Rebellion\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"p\" className=\"mt-6\">\n        The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started to\n        tell jokes and puns again, and soon the entire kingdom was in on the\n        joke.\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"h3\" className=\"mt-8\">\n        The People's Rebellion\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"p\" className=\"mt-6\">\n        The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started to\n        tell jokes and puns again, and soon the entire kingdom was in on the\n        joke.\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"p\" className=\"mt-6\">\n        The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized the error\n        of his ways and repealed the joke tax. Jokester was declared a hero, and\n        the kingdom lived happily ever after.\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"p\" className=\"mt-6\">\n        The moral of the story is: never underestimate the power of a good laugh\n        and always be careful of bad ideas.\n      </Typography>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n",
